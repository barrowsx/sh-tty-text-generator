# sh-tty-text-generator
This is basically an inside joke for my friend's discord channel. It automatically converts a given string into its "sh-tty text" equivalent.

The sh-tty text only has capital letters. For certain punctuation marks, I use the emoji equivalent. For everything else, I just leave it as-is. As of right now it doesn't automatically convert numbers (e.g., 2 does not become :shT: :shW: :shO:) so I just type in numbers manually. The script automatically downcases the string given so input is case insensitive.
