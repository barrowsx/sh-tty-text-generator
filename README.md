# sh-tty-text-generator
This is basically an inside joke for my friend's discord channel. It automatically converts a given string into its "sh-tty text" equivalent.

The sh-tty text only has capital letters. For certain punctuation marks, I use the emoji equivalent. For everything else, I just leave it as-is. The script automatically converts numbers into words (e.g., 2 does not become :shT: :shW: :shO:). The script also automatically downcases the string given so input is case insensitive.
